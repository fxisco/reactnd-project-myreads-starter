# My Reads

Project forked from [reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

This is a book lending app that allows you to pick for a book and categorize it in three sections: _Currently reading_, _want to read_ and _read_.

It is possible to see also the books _page_, _rating_ and _authors_.

This project is a prerequisite for the **React Nanodegree Program**. [Find more info here.](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)
